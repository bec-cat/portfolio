                                    repairing electronic devices. The team was included with 5 designers, where I 
                                    was responsible for the UI/UX design, research and final presentation.

                                                Using the prototypes, we recruited 10 participants to conduct the remote usability testing on our designs. During
                                                the test, we asked them to complete a series of tasks that helped us to understand what their thoughts and see if
                                                they could accomplish the goals. This was also the perfect time to ask about their likes and dislikes for the
                                                prototype.

                                                After the user interviews, we created an affinity map to map out what needed to imrpove and had done well by grouping
                                                into 'driver' and 'customer' categories. By applying the bottom-up approach, we grouped the coded interview into and
                                                sub-categories that focuses on the app's features. In the final interation, we further refined the categories into
                                                clear and meaningful themes.

                                                         We started off with sketching out our <span>low-fidelity prototype</span> in Balsamiq. These sketches were then
                                                        improved to develop <span>mid-fidelity prototype</span> in a more attractive design by using Adobe XD. We implemented
                                                         <span>hi-fidelity</span> with the use of Protopie to create a more interactive prototype.

                                                    Upon completing the final prototype, I believe that my team has designed a mobile application that cover most of the

                                                    3 were needed for the MVP. Thus, we had to keep the prototype minimal to accomplish the app. I was able to learn that
