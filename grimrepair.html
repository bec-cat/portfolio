                        Grim Repair is a mobile application that is designed to simplify the process of repairing electronic
                        devices & offer an end-to-end service including pickup, tracking & delivery.
                        <br><br>This was created as part of a uni capstone course in a group of 5 people, with the objective
                        of supporting people through the use of technology to improve the quality time at home.<br><br>

                    <p>
                        As part of the uni course in the recent pandemic period, my team and I wanted to improve the experience
                        in repairing electronic devices. The goal of this project is to reduce time-consuming through on-demand
                        serivces.
                        <br><br>The team was included with 5 designers, where I was responsible for the UI/UX design, research
                        and final presentation. Here are some of our key achievements listed below:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Key problems were identified. <span>We were able to effectively apply the design process to 
                                identify the problem, ideate on the solution, prototype and implement the final product.</span></li>
                            <li>Executed on-time. <span></span></li>
                            <li>Won a design award. <span>Each person on the team was able to contribute to the solution for the
                                prototype which resulted in a very collaborative and splendid result.</span></li>

                        We conducted a brainstorming and interview session to uncover the pain points felt and experienced by the
                        individuals. It was revealed that:

                    <ul>
                        <li><span>Individuals were unaware of the pricing on repairing electronic devices due to lack of
                            understanding in technology.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Several group of individuals were inaccessible of the location repair.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Individuals wanted to take action in speeding up the turnaround in repair processes.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Individuals would be able to save time without the need to drop off, pickup and wait for the
                            device.</span></li>

                    <p>
                        Within 3 months of developing an idea to constructing hi-fidelity prototype, my team created an approximated
                        timeline with a goal of completing the app. The steps we applied in our design sprint was the Lean UX
                        methodology, which included the phases below.

                        <h3>Key Features (MVP)</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        As a starting point, one of the members conducted <span>competitor analysis</span> to identify the pros and
                        cons of other similar apps and sites. These insights gathered has given opportunities for us to take
                        inspirations from particular features.
                        <br><br>Based on the <span>user assumptions</span> from the Lean UX methodology, we identified the key features:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Driver pickup/delivery. <span>This feature removes the need for the customers to drive to the vendor's
                            location and allow for a quicker turnaround on repairs.</span></li>
                        <li>Vendor price/turnaround comparison. <span>Customers are able to compare vendor prices and turnaround times
                            for their particular issue.</span></li>
                        <li>Real-time tracking. <span>This feature gives the customer a live update of the item's whereabouts and repair
                            progress.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <br><br><p>
                        Few low-fidelity wireframes for the MVP were created:

                        Using the prototypes, we recruited 10 participants to conduct the remote usability testing on our designs. During
                        the test, we asked them to complete a series of tasks that helped us to understand what their thoughts and see if
                        they could accomplish the goals. This was also the perfect time to ask about their likes and dislikes for the
                        prototype.

                        After the user interviews, we created an affinity map to map out what needed to imrpove and had done well by grouping
                        into 'driver' and 'customer' categories. By applying the bottom-up approach, we grouped the coded interview into and
                        sub-categories that focuses on the app's features. In the final interation, we further refined the categories into
                        clear and meaningful themes.

                        improved to develop <span>mid-fidelity prototype</span> in a more attractive design by using Adobe XD. We implemented
                         <span>hi-fidelity</span> with the use of Protopie to create a more interactive prototype.
