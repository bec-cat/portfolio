                        Grim Repair is a mobile application that is designed to simplify the process of repairing electronic
                        devices & offer an end-to-end service including pickup, tracking & delivery.
                        <br><br>This was created as part of a uni capstone course in a group of 5 people, with the objective
                        of supporting people through the use of technology to improve the quality time at home.<br><br>

                    <p>
                        As part of the uni course in the recent pandemic period, my team and I wanted to improve the experience
                        in repairing electronic devices. The goal of this project is to reduce time-consuming through on-demand
                        serivces.
                        <br><br>The team was included with 5 designers, where I was responsible for the UI/UX design, research
                        and final presentation. Here are some of our key achievements listed below:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Key problems were identified. <span>We were able to effectively apply the design process to 
                                identify the problem, ideate on the solution, prototype and implement the final product.</span></li>
                            <li>Executed on-time. <span></span></li>
                            <li>Won a design award. <span>Each person on the team was able to contribute to the solution for the
                                prototype which resulted in a very collaborative and splendid result.</span></li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>
                        We conducted a brainstorming and interview session to uncover the pain points felt and experienced by the
                        individuals. It was revealed that:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>Individuals were unaware of the pricing on repairing electronic devices due to lack of
                            understanding in technology.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Several group of individuals were inaccessible of the location repair.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Individuals wanted to take action in speeding up the turnaround in repair processes.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Individuals would be able to save time without the need to drop off, pickup and wait for the
                            device.</span></li>

                    <p>
                        Within 3 months of developing an idea to constructing hi-fidelity prototype, my team created an approximated
                        timeline with a goal of completing the app. The steps we applied in our design sprint was the Lean UX
                        methodology, which included the phases below.

                        <h3>Key Features (MVP)</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        As a starting point, one of the members conducted <span>competitor analysis</span> to identify the pros and
                        cons of other similar apps and sites. These insights gathered has given opportunities for us to take
                        inspirations from particular features.
                        <br><br>Based on the <span>user assumptions</span> from the Lean UX methodology, we identified the key features:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Driver pickup/delivery. <span>This feature removes the need for the customers to drive to the vendor's
                            location and allow for a quicker turnaround on repairs.</span></li>
                        <li>Vendor price/turnaround comparison. <span>Customers are able to compare vendor prices and turnaround times
                            for their particular issue.</span></li>
                        <li>Real-time tracking. <span>This feature gives the customer a live update of the item's whereabouts and repair
                            progress.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <br><br><p>
                        Few low-fidelity wireframes for the MVP were created:
